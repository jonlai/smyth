# smyth screenshots

This branch exists to separate the screenshots in the main branch's README from any clones of this repo by plugin manaagers.

## notes

* The iTerm viewport window size is 90x30 for the screenshots.
* Some of the example code has been edited to demonstrate the git gutter colors and specific syntax colors for lines of code. To reproduce the same lines of code in the viewport, apply the `sample-code/screenshot-viewport.diff` and match the lines displayed in the existing screenshots.
* Use macOS's Command+Shift+5 -> "Capture Selected Window" and click on the iTerm window while holding Option to remove box shadow from the resulting screenshot.
* macOS's screenshots can output a high resolution and image size. Make sure to resive the images to 750x466px at 200ppi resolution.
